## GfK: Transforming Design Operations for Digital Analytics

### Challenge

In 2020, GfK transitioned from traditional market research to a digital analytics platform. This transformation required an overhaul of the design team’s operational model during a global pandemic. Key issues included fragmented communication, limited alignment with company goals, and a lack of opportunities for designers to engage in meaningful problem-solving.

**Key Issues Identified:**

- **Alignment:** Team members felt disconnected from the broader company vision, diminishing purpose and direction.
- **Visibility:** Siloed knowledge led to isolated individuals and redundant efforts.
- **Empathy:** Designers were handed solutions instead of being involved in defining problems, stifling creativity.

---

### Objectives

We set clear targets to improve team health, effectiveness, and alignment:

- Increase the percentage of team members reporting they can do their best work daily from **35%** to **50%**.
- Raise the number of team members feeling part of a healthy team from **45%** to **60%**.
- Expand ideation time while reducing communication channel fragmentation.

### Solution Framework: Culture, Structure, Strategy

**Culture: Building a Stronger Team**

- Instituted meeting hygiene with regular **standups, 1:1s, retrospectives, and critiques**.
- Paired designers to foster skill-sharing and collaboration.
- Enhanced partner communication and introduced **“Lunch and Learn” sessions**.

**Structure: Supporting Responsible Growth**

- Reorganized the design team into **thematic squads** (e.g., data visualization, UI components, onboarding).
- Secured approval for **10 new design roles**, alleviating resource pressure.
- Created a **“Zero to Hero” onboarding guide** for new hires, including essential contacts, meeting schedules, and key resources.

**Strategy: Making the Vision Real**

- Developed a shared **product vision** and **roadmap** with bi-weekly updates for alignment.
- Educated Product Managers (PMs) on the design process and introduced shared metrics for design and PM teams.
- Published comprehensive design and content standards using **Zeroheight**.

### Implementation

Key initiatives included:

- Transitioning to **cross-functional squads** for enhanced collaboration.
- Rationalizing communication by reducing **Slack channels from 73 to 9**.
- Shifting from slide-based presentations to **live collaboration in Figma**.
- Conducting **Design Jams** to foster collaboration outside routine structures.
- Introducing monthly progress share-outs to the wider company for visibility and alignment.
